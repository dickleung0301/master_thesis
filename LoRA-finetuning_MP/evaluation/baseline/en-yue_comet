Bear and Mouse took it to the bedroom and enjoyed it together. They even made the biggest mess, but their fur was still so fluffy and soft.

John went to the forest and searched for the treasure. He looked everywhere but he couldn't find it. As he was walking home, he saw a group of mean boys. They took John's toys and ran away.
