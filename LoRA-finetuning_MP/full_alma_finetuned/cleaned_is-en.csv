Fær ekki sekt fyrir 27 milljóna króna Bitcoin-uppskeru,Will not be fined for ISK 27 million Bitcoin harvesting,Don't get fined for a 27 million króna Bitcoin profit
Yfirskattanefnd hefur hafnað kröfu skattrannsóknarstjóra sem krafðist sektar yfir manni fyrir að vanframtelja fjármagnstekjur sínar sem voru til komnar vegna sölu á rafmyntinni Bitcoin.,The State Internal Revenue Board has rejected a claim from the Director of Tax Investigations demanding that a man be fined for underreporting capital income from sales of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.,The tax assessment committee has rejected the tax auditor's claim for a fine against a man for failing to report income from the sale of the digital currency Bitcoin.
Nefndin kemst að þeirri niðurstöðu að skattrannsóknarstjóri hefði ekki fært skýr rök fyrir af hverju nauðsynlegt væri að sekta manninn.,The Board concludes that the Director of Tax Investigations has not provided clear arguments for the necessity of fining the man.,The committee came to the conclusion that the tax inspector had not provided clear reasons why it was necessary to prosecute the man.
Í úrskurði nefndarinnar kemur fram að skattrannsóknarstjóri taldi manninn hafa staði skil á efnislega röngum skattframtölum vegna tekjuáranna 2016 og 2017.,"According to the Board's ruling, the Director of Tax Investigations believed that the man had filed materially false tax statements for the income years of 2016 and 2017.",In the verdict of the committee it is stated that the tax investigation manager believed the man had been guilty of incorrect tax declarations due to income from the years 2016 and 2017.
"Hann hefði vanframtalið fjármagnstekjur sínar sem væru til komnar vegna sölu af rafmyntinni Bitcoin upp á 27 milljónir, annað hvort viljandi eða af stórkostlegu hirðuleysi.","He was said to have underreported financial income from sales of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin amounting to ISK 27 million, either intentionally or due to gross negligence.","He would have had to pay taxes on the income he received from the sale of the Bitcoin currency, which was worth 27 million, either voluntarily or due to gross negligence."
Sekta bæri manninn fyrir háttsemi sína.,The man should consequently be fined for his conduct.,The sect is bearing the man for his behavior.
Maðurinn hafnaði því í bréfi til nefndarinnar.,The man rejected this in a letter to the Board.,The man refused it in a letter to the committee.
Hann gekkst þó við því að hafa árið 2016 selt rafmynt fyrir 27 milljónir.,"He did, however, admit to selling cryptocurrency for ISK 27 million in 2016.","He did, however, have the year 2016 sold electricity for 27 million."
Hana hefði hann eignast með greftri á árunum 2009 og 2010 þegar slíkt hefði bæði verið auðvelt og ódyrt með venjulegri heimilistölvu.,"He said that he acquired this cryptocurrency through mining in the years 2009 and 2010, at a time when this could be done both easily and inexpensively with an ordinary home computer.",He could have acquired it with thrift in the years 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
Þá benti hann á að þegar hann seldi rafmyntina hefði skattframkvæmd vegna slíkrar sölu verið verulega óljós og ófyrirsjáanleg.,"He also pointed out that when he sold the cryptocurrency, the administration of taxes for such sales was highly ambiguous and unpredictable.",Then he pointed out that when he sold the electricity he would have been subject to a tax enforcement due to such a sale would have been very unclear and opaque.
Tæpast hefði verið hægt að ætlast til þess að almennir borgarar gerðu sér grein fyrir slíkum ráðstöfunum á skattframtali.,Members of the general public could hardly have been expected to be aware of such arrangements in their tax statement.,It would have been possible to assume that ordinary citizens would take note of such measures in the tax bill.
Hann hefði ekki ætlað að komast hjá því að greiða skatt af uppskerunni og hefði gert grein fyrir eign sinni á framtali sem innstæðu á gjaldeyrisreikningi.,He said that he did not intend to avoid paying taxes on his harvesting and that he had reported his asset in the statement as a deposit in a currency account.,He would not have intended to avoid paying tax on the income and would have made a claim for his property on the statement of account as a deduction on the tax return.

Skoðanakannanir hafa sýnt að þrátt fyrir að Trump tryggði sér nauman meirihluta í úthverfunum 2016 hefur fylgi hans þar dregist verulega saman.,"Polls have shown that although Trump secured a narrow majority of suburban voters in 2016, his support among them has decreased significantly.","Pollsters have shown that despite Trump securing a majority in the swing states in 2016, his support there has plummeted."
Þó það sé mismunandi á milli kannana hefur Biden mælst með um fimmtán prósentustiga forskot á Trump í útverfunum að undanförnu.,"Although polls have varied, Biden has recently been measured as having a fifteen percent lead on Trump in the suburbs.","Although it varies between polls, Biden has led Trump by about 15 percentage points in the battleground states in recent polls."

Þegar tilkynnt var að Tókýó í Japan yrði vettvangur Ólympíuleikanna í ár voru fagnaðarlæti japönsku fulltrúanna ósvikin.,"When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the site of this year's Olympics, the celebrations of the Japanese delegates were genuine.","When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue for the Olympics in the year, the Japanese delegation's welcome ceremony was unmarred."

Enginn vill þó alveg hugsa þá hugsun til enda.,But this is something that no one really wants to contemplate.,No one wants to think about that thought to the end.
Ólympíuleikar eru engin venjuleg íþróttakeppni.,The Olympic Games are no ordinary sporting competition.,The Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
"Ekkert er til sparað, sýningin á alltaf að vera stórkostleg og leitast í við að toppa síðustu leika.","No expense is spared, the spectacle is always supposed to be dazzling and top the previous games.","Nothing is saved, the show is always to be grand and strive to top the last game."
Valið á borg fyrir Ólympíuleika byggir á mati valnefndar á kynningum borganna.,The selection of a host city for the Olympics is based on how an evaluation commission rates the cities' presentations.,The city chosen for the Olympics is based on the evaluation of the evaluation committee after presentations of the cities.
Því stórfenglegri sem kynningin er — því meiri líkur á að hljóta hnossið.,The more spectacular the presentation — the more likely it is to be awarded.,The more sensational the introduction is — the greater the likelihood of getting the attention.
Tókýó varði 150 milljónum dala í að reyna að fá að halda Ólympíuleikana 2016 eða sem nemur ríflega 20 milljörðum króna.,"Tokyo spent USD 150 million on its bid to host the 2016 Olympics, or the equivalent of over ISK 20 billion.",Tokyo spent 150 million dollars to try to keep the 2016 Olympics or roughly 20 billion kronur.
"Í seinna skiptið, þegar sótt var um leikana 2020, voru 75 milljónir dala, um tíu milljarðar króna, settir í kynninguna.","In the second instance, in the application for the 2020 games, USD 75 million, about ISK 10 billion, was spent on the promotion.","In the later stages, when the bid for the 2020 games was made, 75 million dala, or about 10 billion kronur, was put into the bid."
"Árið 2013, þegar ákveðið var að Tókýó fengið leikana í ár, höfðu japönsk yfirvöld þannig þegar varið sem nemur 30 milljörðum króna til verkefnisins.","In 2013, when it was decided that Toyko would be awarded this year's games, Japanese authorities had therefore already spent the equivalent of ISK 30 billion on the project.","In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the games in the year, the Japanese government had already set aside 30 billion yen for the project."
"En sú upphæð er þó bara dropi í hafið miðað við hvað það kostar að byggja Ólympíuþorp, leikvanga og almennt að styrkja innviði landsins til að ráða við svona mót, undirbúa það og halda sjálfa leikana.","But this amount is only a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of building an Olympic village and stadiums, and the general cost of strengthening the country's infrastructures in order to be able to manage such a tournament, preparing for it and holding the games themselves.","That amount is, however, just a drop in the ocean compared to what it costs to build an Olympic village, arenas and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to host such a tournament, prepare for it and hold the games themselves."
"Skipuleggjendur í Japan hafa sagt að Ólympíuleikarnir í Tókýó, sem hefðu átt að vera í gangi þessa dagana en hefur verið frestað um eitt ár vegna kórónuveirunnar, myndu hafa kostað 12,6 milljarða dala.","The Japanese organisers have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be taking place now but have been postponed for a year because of the coronavirus, would have cost USD 12.6 billion.","Organizers in Japan have said that the Tokyo Olympics, which were scheduled to take place this week but have been postponed by one year due to the coronavirus, would have cost 12.6 billion yen."
Í skýrslu frá ríkisendurskoðanda í Japan sem út kom í lok síðasta árs kom þó fram að nær væri að kostnaðurinn væri tvöföld sú tala.,"However, a report by the Japanese Board of Audit, published at the end of last year, revealed that the actual cost was closer to double that figure.","In a report from the state auditor in Japan which came out at the end of last year, it was however stated that the cost would be twice as much as the talk."
Líklega verður ekki hægt að leggja fyllilega mat á kostnaðinn við að fresta leikunum en áætlað hefur verið að það geti kostað á bilinu tvo til sex milljarða dala til viðbótar við upphaflegan kostnað.,"It's probably not possible to fully assess the cost of postponing the games but according to estimates, the cost may be from two to six billion dollars, in addition to the original cost.","It is likely that it will not be possible to put a full price tag on the cost of delaying the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the original cost."
Heildarkostnaður fyrir japönsku Ólympíunefndina og japanska skattgreiðendur gæti því hlaupið á bilinu 15 til 30 milljörðum dala.,The full cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese tax payers could therefore range from 15 to 30 billion dollars.,Total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
"Það eru svo háar tölur að allar skatttekjur íslenska ríkisins dygðu aðeins fyrir um tæplega hálfum Ólympíuleikum, miðað við lægsta mögulega kostnað.","These numbers are so high that all of the Icelandic State's tax income would only cover just under half the Olympics, assuming the lowest possible cost.","That's so high a number that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state would only cover half of the Olympics, at the lowest possible cost."
"Ólympíuleikar eru viðburður af þeirri stærðargráðu að þeir hafa gjarnan orðið umfjöllunarefni hagfræðinga, sem reyna að rýna í tölur og skoða ávinning og ábata af leikunum.",The Olympic Games are an event of such magnitude that they have often been the subject of economists who attempt to review the figures and study the benefits and gains from the games.,"The Olympics are an event of such magnitude that they have often become a subject of discussion among economists, who try to crunch numbers and examine the benefits and drawbacks of the games."
Í sem stystu máli virðast ansi margir hafa komist að þeirri niðurstöðu að áhrif Ólympíuleikanna séu síður en svo jákvæð fyrir efnahag þeirra borga sem halda þá.,"In short, quite a number of people seem to have concluded that the effects of the Olympics are anything but positive for the economy of the host cities.","In the most extreme case, it appears that many have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympics are less than so positive for the economy of the cities that host them."
"Skammtímaáhrif eru einhver, til dæmis fjölgar störfum mjög mikið til skamms tíma, en til lengri tíma sitja borgir gjarnan uppi með skuldahala og ógnarháan rekstrarkostnað lítið notaðra mannvirkja.","There are some short-term effects, including a great short-term increase in jobs, but in the longer term, cites are often left with a trail of debts and enormous operating costs for little-used facilities.","Time-shares have some effects, for example, work is multiplied very much for short periods of time, but for longer periods of time, cities usually sit with a high debt burden and a threat of low use of infrastructure."
Ríó í Brasilíu situr uppi með verulegar skuldir vegna leikanna 2016 og hefur verið í vandræðum með að kosta viðhald á öllum þeim stóru íþróttamannvirkjum sem byggð voru fyrir leikana.,"Rio, Brazil, is left with significant debts from the 2016 games and has had trouble funding the maintenance of all the large sports facilities that were built for the games.",The Rio de Janeiro stadium is sitting on a mountain of debt from the 2016 games and has been struggling to maintain upkeep on all the massive sports facilities built for the games.
Rýnt hefur verið í tölur eftir leikana í London 2012 en þar hefur komið í ljós að aðeins 10 prósent þeirra sem fengu atvinnu tengda Ólympíuleikunum í borginni voru atvinnulaus áður.,A study of the figures from the 2012 games in London has shown that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympic games in the city were unemployed before.,"There has been a lot of talk about the numbers after the games in London 2012, but it has become clear that only 10 percent of those who got employment related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before."
Það þýðir að ekki var um að ræða ný störf nema að litlu leyti.,This means that new jobs weren't created except to a limited extent.,"It means that it was not about new jobs, but to a small extent."
Almennt hafa borgir ekki komið sérlega vel út úr því fjárhagslega að halda Ólympíuleika vegna þess sligandi kostnaðar sem fylgir mannvirkjunum sem byggð eru fyrir leikana.,"In general, cities have not been particularly economically successful in hosting the Olympics because of the onerous costs related to the structures built for the games.","Generally, cities have not come out particularly well financially from hosting the Olympics due to the massive costs associated with the infrastructure built for the games."
"Ávinningur er þó gjarnan talinn felast í aukinni umferð ferðamanna sem vilji heimsækja Ólympíuborgirnar í kjölfar leikanna, sem þó er mikil óvissa um varðandi leikana 2021.","On the other hand, many believe there to be a benefit in the increased traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, although this is highly uncertain when it comes to the 2021 games.","The benefit is however often considered to be in the increased traffic of tourists who wish to visit the Olympic cities following the games, although there is great uncertainty regarding the 2021 games."
Einnig er óvíst hvort hægt verður að taka við öllum þeim fjölda áhorfenda sem vanalega sækja leikana.,It is also unclear whether it's possible to receive the large number of spectators who usually attend the games.,It is also uncertain whether it will be possible to accommodate all the usual spectators.
"Aðalmálið er þó heiðurinn sem borgunum hlotnast að vera valdar, en hann er erfitt að meta til fjár.","Most important, however, is the honour accorded to the cities in being selected, which is difficult to assess in terms of money.","The main thing is the honour that the municipalities get to be in charge, but it is difficult to measure in terms of money."
Því þrátt fyrir gríðarlegan kostnað þá má líka að segja að gleðin sem leikarnir færa sé ekki þess eðlis að hægt sé að setja á hana verðmiða.,"The fact is that despite the enormous costs, it could also be said that the joy created by the games is of such a nature that it's impossible to put a price tag on it.","Despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the players bring is not of a kind that can be valued."
En þótt sýningin sé gjarnan mikilfengleg og hvergi sé til sparað þá snýst þetta auðvitað ekki bara um peninga.,"But although the spectacle is often impressive and no expense is spared, money is of course not the only issue.","Although the exhibition is often very popular and nowhere to be saved, this is not just about money."
Það eru íþróttahetjurnar sem eru í forgrunni.,The sports stars are at the forefront.,It's the sports heroes who are in the forefront.
Fyrir sumt afreksfólk er það óvart bara kærkomið að fresta leikunum.,"For some elite athletes, postponing the games is an accidental blessing.","For some thrill-seekers, it's a pleasant surprise to postpone the games."
"Ástralska fimmþrautarkonan og gullverðlaunahafi í sinni grein á síðusu Ólympíuleikum, Chloe Esposito, er til dæmis kasólétt og hefði verið fjarri góðu gamni í sumar en eygir von um að vera komin í keppnisform fyrir leikana 2021.","One of these is Australian pentathlon competitor and gold medallist at the last Olympics, Chloe Esposito, who is heavily pregnant and would have been absent this summer but is hoping to be in competitive shape for the 2021 games.","Australian pentathlete and gold medalist at the Rio Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is a ray of sunshine and has been a bit off colour in the summer but is hopeful of being back in competition form for the 2021 games."

Treysta líkama sínum einfaldlega ekki til þess að fara í gegnum ár í viðbót af ströngum æfingum.,They simply do not trust their body to withstand another year of hard training.,Trust your body to simply not go through a year of intense training.

Hún kom heim með fjögur gull um hálsinn og eitt brons.,She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.,She came home with four gold medals around her neck and one bronze.

"Hún ætlar sér á leikana 2021 en hún er þó ekkert endilega viss um að hún nái að vera enn á toppnum á leikunum á næsta ári, enda verður hún þá orðin 24 ára.","She intends to go to the 2021 games but is not certain that she will still be at her peak at the games next year, when she will be 24 years old.","She is planning to play in 2021, but it is not clear if she will be able to stay at the top of the games next year, as she will then be 24 years old."
Þótt það sé almennt ekki talinn hár aldur er það í hærra lagi fyrir fimleikakonu í fremstu röð.,"Although that is generally not considered old, it is rather much for a top-flight gymnast.","Although it is not generally considered old age, it is certainly high time for a woman of the theatre to retire."
"„Þetta er viðkvæmt málefni,“ segir Biles en brosir þó út í annað í viðtali sem birt var á Instagram-síðu Ólympíunefndarinnar spurð að því hvort hún ætli sér að ná jafnlangt á leikunum 2021 og hún gerði í Ríó 2016.
assistant","""This is a delicate subject"" says Biles with a slight smile in an interview on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page when asked whether she intends to be as successful at the 2021 games as she was in Rio in 2016.","„This is a sensitive matter,"" says Biles, but then veers off into another topic in an interview posted on the Olympic Committee's Instagram page, asking if she aims to match her performance in 2021 with what she did in Rio"
"„Ég hreinlega veit ekki hvort ég verð enn á toppnum eftir heilt ár í viðbót af æfingum,“ segir Biles.","""I simply don't know whether I'll still be at the top after another whole year of training,"" says Biles.","„I really don't know if I'll be on top after a full year of training,"" says Biles."
Hún hefur áður talað um að líkami hennar þoli ekki álagið sem fylgir fimleikaþjálfun mikið lengur.,She has previously said that her body will not stand the strain of gymnastic training much longer.,She has previously spoken about her body not being able to withstand the demands of intense training for much longer.
Engu að síður æfir hún af kappi fyrir Ólympíuleikana 2021.,She is nevertheless training enthusiastically for the 2021 Olympics.,She is currently training hard for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles viðurkennir að það hafi verið óþægileg tilfinning að þurfa að hætta skyndilega að æfa þegar heimsfaraldurinn stóð sem hæst og fimleikasalnum var lokað.,Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to stop training all of a sudden when the gymnasium was closed at the height of the pandemic.,Biles acknowledges that it was unpleasant to have to stop training when the pandemic was at its peak and the gymnastics hall was closed.
Engar undanþágur voru fyrir Biles frekar en aðra meðan öllum íþróttamannvirkjum var lokað í sjö vikur.,"Just as with everyone else, there were no exemptions for Biles while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.","No exceptions were made for Biles before the others, while all sports activities were closed for seven weeks."
"Öll hennar Ólympíugull gátu ekki keypt neinn aðgang umfram hina, hún þurfti að finna ýmsar leiðir til að halda sér í formi líkt og aðrir.","All her Olympic gold medals could not buy her any priority access and like others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape.","All her Olympic medals could not buy her access above the rest, she had to find various ways to keep herself in shape like the others."
Grunnformið vissulega ögn betra en hjá flestu fólki.,The basic form is certainly a little better than for most people.,The basic form is probably more common than among most people.
„Við erum með stífa áætlun núna.,"""We have a strict schedule now.",„We have a tight schedule now.
Það var erfitt að byrja að æfa fyrst aftur eftir að fimleikasalurinn opnaði.,It was hard to begin training again when the gymnasium first opened again.,It was hard to start practicing again after the gym opened.
Við byrjuðum hægt en erum komin á fullan skrið að nýju og ég mun auka við æfingarnar jafnt og þétt eftir því sem líður á árið.,We began slowly but have reached full speed again and I will gradually add to the training as the year goes on.,We started off easy but we're now full steam ahead and I'm going to increase the training sessions as much as possible throughout the year.
"Við vitum auðvitað ekki alveg hvernig þessir leikar verða eða hvort þeir verða haldnir en við æfum samt miðað við að þeir verði, getum ekki annað.","Obviously, we don't know for sure how these games will be, or whether they will be held, but we can't do anything but train as if they will take place.",We don't know exactly how these games will be or if they will be held but we are training for them anyway.
"Ég er búin að leggja of mikið á mig til að yfirgefa íþróttina núna,“ segir Biles.","I have put in too much effort to leave the sport now,"" says Biles.","I've put too much pressure on myself to leave the sport now,"" Biles said."
Með henni líkt og fleirum blundar efi eða kannski frekar meðvitund um að sú staða geti komið upp að leikarnir verði alls ekki haldnir 2021 heldur.,"She, like others, has some doubts, or perhaps rather awareness of the possibility of the games not being held in 2021 either.","With her, as with many others, the thought of the possibility of the games not being held in 2021 is a bit of a blur or maybe more of a conscious awareness."
